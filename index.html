      <h2>About me:</h2>      
      <article class="flavor">
        I joined the GitHub Developer Community in December 2023, and I am currently attending the Founders and Coders coding support group. I have more than ten years experience working as administrator; from June 2008 to September 2011 I was working as Central Core Management Unit (CCMU) Administrator for SLaM Training Centre. And from September 2011 to November 2023 I was working as R&D Administrator for the NHS.</p>
           
        <p class="flavor">I enjoy working as part of a team and I am comfortable working unsupervised. I have the ability to maintain confidentiality appropriately and understand the issues involved, I have experience of dealing with documents and correspondence of a sensitive nature and I have knowledge of administrative procedures, project management and information analysis.</p>
        
        <p class="flavor">I completed a Higher National Diploma in Software Engineering at Kingston University, London, UK.</p>        

        <p class="flavor">I enjoy playing  cards with friends, keeping in contact with them on social media like Facebook, or WhatsApp, shopping online using Amazon or eBay, I like to experiment with food, etc. I visited various parts of Africa, America, Asia, and Europe.</p>

      <h2>Reasons why I would like to move into a career as Web Developer:</h2>
      <article class="flavor">
        I completed a Software Engineering course at University in London, and I would like to persue my career in software development programming with C++, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and some SQL and Matlab; ideally, working remotely. I have a friend in London who works remotely and he is also a JavaScript developer, I hope I will be that lucky to find a role that allows me to work remotely. I also have a friend who works in Disneyland in Paris and he also works remotely, but as an administrator; I know that there are people who prefer to go to the office, but I prefer to work remotely instead, if given the choice, also because I have some health issues about commuting. I am currently studying JavaScript, CSS, and HTML on a course of study from Founders and Coders, during which I have made a project game that you can try by using the following link: <a href="Curriculum Vitae (updated).pdf" style="color: blue">Click here to start the Rock Paper Scissors game</a></style>
